We will begin with a brief look at historic slavery in Europe and Africa and some of the \"timeless\" aspects of slavery, including sexual abuse, relationships with free people, economic roles, access to freedom or manumission, and rebellion. We will then proceed to a more in-depth examination of African slavery in the Americas, including the United States, between roughly 1492 and the late 1800s. Finally, we will draw from our reflections on historic slavery to examine contemporary forms of human trafficking. Throughout the course we will discuss several common themes in accounts of enslaved and/or trafficked people: their legal status; demographics and work routines; treatment; \"conditions of life\"; community and culture; access to freedom; relationship to the culture and society of free people; historic and contemporary consumer demands for enslaved and trafficked humans; and life after liberation.\n (Odd Falls)"},{"dept":"anth","number":"3501","name":"Research Experience in Anthropology","hours":[1,3],"semester":"Fall, Spring, Summer","id":"anth 3501","prereq":{"type":"true"},"coreq":{"type":"true"},"preorco":{"type":"true"},"desc":"Research participation and/or independent supervised research in anthropology.
